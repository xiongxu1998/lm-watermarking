decoded_output_with_watermark:  the man, from the us, was diagnosed after he played the game for weeks . it was normal for people to tear the tendon where it is thinnest, doctors claim . but the patient, who was not addicted, said he felt no pain at all . it is believed that video games can increase people's pain tolerance . scientists have suggested that the ‘painkiller effect’ is important during painful medical procedures, such as surgery, rehabilitation, or rehabilitation, such as brain surgery, for example .

A video reveals that Scott was shot to death by a police officer . but we don't have enough comprehensive data about police killings to make an informed judgment .

It is important that the truth is brought out, Burr says, but it is impossible. "What happened here today does happen ... but it does happen," Stewart says. "What if there was no video? What if there was no witness?" the attorney asked. "In the end, it was the officer, it was the officer," says Burr. "Everybody knows that it was Walter," adding

decoded_output_with_watermark:  the Fanuc robot is designed to work alongside humans without the need for safety fences, including the use of security cameras . it can lift objects weighing up to 77 lbs (35kg) the robot stops what it's doing if it touches a human. This is down to integrated vision which lets it 'see' human employees . it is the first robot that can move objects between people, such as shelving, packing, etc, using wireless transmitters that connect to the robot . the winning robot is worth $2

decoded_output_with_watermark:  the CYG-11 is a new type of seaplane created by chinese engineers . it uses reduced drag and increased lift from the wing-in-ground effect . the aircraft can fly 62 miles (100 km) on 28 litres of fuel and 155 mph (250 km/h) . the new aircraft can be used to patrol coastlines and create tourism routes .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  the aircraft uses the wing-in-ground effect where the aircraft can glide on the surface of the water on a cushion of air . it was developed by the Hainan yinggewing in ground effect craft manufacturing company with the help of Russian engineers . the aircraft can reach speeds between 175 km/h (250 km/h) when it is used like a catamaran, it can drift between 3 - 5 m (1.5-1.5 metres) off the coast of the hainan province . it
