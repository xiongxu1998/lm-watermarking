It does not prescribe a specific time frame for the procedure, but allows it if "necessary" to protect the mother's life .

decoded_output_with_watermark:  experiments on the space station will look at plants that can sense, and adapt, the force that is happening on the planet, including the direction it is moving . the Japanese space agency (jaxa) is running the experiment, which will use new space-craft that can reach the station on 13 April . the findings could help farmers on the earth, such as the people currently out on the drought, get higher crop yields, or prevent the disease-causing floods on the red planet . it is the second study on the station, but

decoded_output_with_watermark:  spiderFab uses arachnid-like robots to construct large objects in orbit around the Earth or further into the Solar System . the spiders can then be used to piece together the materials in orbit . new technology will also allow NASA to use small, low-cost launch vehicles to deploy systems significantly larger than currently possible .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  spider-like robots can build spacecraft using existing techniques, such as laser welding, that can be used on existing spacecraft, such as communications dishes, and spacewalks. the firm is currently deploying the spider-like robot, which is known as the ‘trusselator,’ using three-dimensional printing techniques. the spider-like robot, which is still relatively new, is still the brain child of co-founder, dr. john dewhurst. the firm is currently looking to expand the spider-like robot, which

Mr Byng, from the south west, was photographing the birds when the encounter unfolded . he was looking out the window when the creature from the sky broke into song, apparently looking for prey . the fleeing goose did well, though, fleeing the threat, although it was unsuccessful, leaving the fox with one feather on the back of the goose's tail

Boudicca was queen of the Iceni people who tried to defeat the romans .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  remains have now been found, including one from the 16th century . scientists think the heads on the skulls represent heads of the dead . it was previously believed the remains were washed downstream from the river . new evidence does, however, strongly suggest the remains have been cremated . it is the second major historic find made during the project on river Walbrook, which is part of the new railway station that is due to open later this year . the findings have ignited the idea the remains could have been the remains of Boudic

decoded_output_with_watermark:  was gifted to the Founders Group in 2007. But the plan failed and the mall remained empty. Now, in 2013, the Founders Group is hoping for a third time lucky. . in the mall's entirety, many of the 400,000 units have been renovated. But the rest is still empty.
decoded_output_with_watermark:  was listed as "dead mall" again. In the process, the brand was bought out, the project was abandoned, the building was abandoned again. Recently, the new owners have attempted a second attempt. Last October, the building was again listed on the national website, but it remains abandoned.

It was dismissed, but the findings were made public last year, the suit says. It does detail the protocol, but it does say the experiments did happen. It did, but the findings weren't made public, the suit is now. It is the second attempt to collect damages. In the second, it was dismissed.

decoded_output_with_watermark:  china's dalian nationalities university are building a prototype of the device . it combines a bike and washing machine by changing the front wheel . when ridden, the pedalling motion causes the drum to rotate . this rotates churning your clothes like a traditional washing machine .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  the new invention from dalian nationalities university is due to ship early next year but it is believed it would have to be built using existing existing machinery . when the wheel is ridden, the pedalling motion causes the drum to rotate, churning the user's clothes like a traditional washer . the idea is ideal for using the exercise bike to do the laundry, but the design would also generate power that would power other household items, such as the dishwasher . the wheel washing machine, which was developed by si .
