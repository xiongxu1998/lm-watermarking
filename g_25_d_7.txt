decoded_output_with_watermark:  in 84 days from November 2013 to January 2014, the area around Azle, Texas, shook with 27 magnitude two or greater earthquakes . scientists believe these earthquakes were the result of injecting wastewater into the ground . they determined this based on where and when the earthquakes happened . the study also sees a secondary link in nearby brine production wells . these wells are located both near the faults and near earthquake epicentres .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  scientists think the series of major local earthquakes was due to the use of hydraulic fluid from well-dredged well-and-drew wells that produced brine during the 2014 period . the scientists discovered the cause was the use of the well-dredged well-and-drew well, which is used, like the well, to process the wastewater out the hole, changing the underwater pressure. the scientists have identified the epicentre from the study, which was between 11-12 magnitude, which was associated with the ruptured well

decoded_output_with_watermark:  in the city of Xiamen, which is now a far more isolated city. The plant was originally planned for Xiamen, but protests in 2007 forced the city to relocate it. The new plant has been operational since 2010 and produces 68,000 tons of PX per year, the agency said Tuesday.
decoded_output_with_watermark:  when it was originally scheduled. It was decommissioned due, according local media, to protests. It was again decommissioned last June, though it was still operational. It was scheduled to open in the western Fujian district, but it was decommissioned due, local media have reported. It is one of several new chemical projects that have deterred protest. In 2014, the national chemical firm produced 10 billion pounds worth. Of that, 10 tons was used from 2014 on.. "Our firm is looking forward."
