decoded_output_with_watermark:  study was made when doctors were seeing increasing numbers of obese or overweight patients wanting to join popular diet plans . three 'high-intensity' programmes such as weight watchers, Jenny Craig and nutrisystem featured on the study. only twelve out of 4,200 studies used clinical trials . some showed the programmes were better than diets using counselling alone, while some carried higher risks of complications such as gallstones . a few, such as the low-cal, low-carb diet, such as the atkins diet,

decoded_output_with_watermark:  Nina Pham is suing the operator of the hospital, which is where the patient died, seeking unspecified damages . the operator, which denied the allegations, filed the response on Friday, which the hospital says it filed last week. the hospital also said it acted responsibly, including using the best available evidence from the Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, that the disease was spread from patient to patient. the attorney for the patient, though, said the hospital was wrong to claim that the patient was not a patient.

That is, the hostage-taking is part of the regime's agenda. It is a deranged, dangerous regime. And it is dangerous. It is the regime that is driving the hostage-taking, says Richard Nixon .
