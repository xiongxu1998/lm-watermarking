decoded_output_with_watermark:  Natasha hope-simpson lost part of her leg below the knee in a hit-and-run accident last year but because her prosthetic leg was covered, one person thought she was lying because she was wearing one . hope-simpson turned the note into an opportunity to create art because she is able to wear the design on her leg . the alleles design studio, founded by artist McCauley wanner, 27, and designer Ryan palibroda, 32, was founded to help people with disabilities

decoded_output_with_watermark:  Google's Waze application allows users to tag the locations of parked police vehicles, accidents, traffic cameras, potholes and more . there are growing concerns that the app poses a danger to police because of its ability to track their locations . it is currently only available in the u.s., but is gaining popularity in other countries .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  Google bought the app for $1.1 billion in 2013 . now the firm is under pressure from top law enforcement officers to turn off the app's police-tracking function . the app is used to post details on accidents, accidents, traffic cameras, potholes, etc, which users can then share with others . but critics claim using the app to stalk police is dangerous . the app was used to ambush two officers in Brooklyn last month, but the officers were not targeted because the suspect threw his phone far from where

decoded_output_with_watermark:  do behaviours and preferences result from nature or nurture? Dr Michael Mosley examines the links between gender and the brain . the study of the ring finger in men shows that men are more ‘male brained’ — i.e. more ‘powerful at breaking down and analysing systems’ than women . and women are more empathisers — they are more likely to become politicians .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  the SBS One series Horizon examines the links between gender, the brain and habits such as exercise, sleep and emotional states . it is asked by researchers from the University of south australia, where we discovered that males have different brains to females . the findings have caused much debate, with some scientists believing that the brain is more ‘male brained’ than is ‘empathised’ . my brain is a male brain, but when it is tested it is much smaller, which is very male brained .
