decoded_output_with_watermark:  study looked at stone tools used by people in south and west europe . they found the human tools were no more effective than Neanderthals . this means we may not have behaved as differently as first thought . one theory is that early modern humans 'bullied' their Neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive . but the new research reveals a timeline that doesn't support this theory . it suggests the stone points appeared in europe 3,000 years earlier than in
