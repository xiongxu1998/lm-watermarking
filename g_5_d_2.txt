Both are new to navigating the skies . the plane's flight has been delayed by weather in China. "Our boss is the sun," says Durgnat. "We're getting used to that."
decoded_output_with_watermark:  . The pair has travelled the world as explorers, including a balloon flight around the world. They say the mission is aiming to prove the power of renewable energy, and inspiring innovation. Both have a long history of travel, including completing the 68,000-mile Trans-Atlantic flight in 1997. Andre Borschberg, 22, of Switzerland, is part of the Solar Impulse 2 team. Despite the setback, Piccard says he is "doing it because it's worth it"

decoded_output_with_watermark:  a story that is indicative of a broader, more complex relationship between these two populations. It generates heat, but not light. It's time to call this persistent meme what it is: a misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction.
decoded_output_with_watermark:  hardly any evidence to suggest that it does. It's a story that should not be buried under cliches or clickbait. There's a far more nuanced relationship between the communities, he says. Rather, this story is a distraction that shifts blame away from the real issue.

decoded_output_with_watermark:  study finds that 100,000 people in the path of a tsunami could be in danger . 77% of communities in danger are equipped to handle a tsunami evacuation . 'highly vulnerable' communities in the three states would need extra time to reach higher ground, the study finds .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  study reveals the communities that would not have the time to successfully evacuate if a tsunami hit . more than 100,000 people live along the coast of the Pacific Northwest, including places like Aberdeen, where people couldn't reach safety . many communities would 'need' to build evacuation structures or to use the right kind of community-developed land to ensure a relatively short distance to higher ground . study authors say communities would 'need to take self-protective action' to ensure a 'very high degree of protection'
