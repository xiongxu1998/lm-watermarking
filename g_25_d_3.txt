decoded_output_with_watermark:  one in five people have never seen a hedgehog in their gardens, survey finds . part of the reason is the widespread loss of the traditional hedgerows . but the loss of bushes and hedges in back gardens is also thought to have contributed . 6 out of 10 people have never seen a grass snake, according to the survey . conservationists fear that once-common snakes are also vanishing .

decoded_output_with_watermark:  supporting Saudi aggression will only escalate the conflict and further open the Yemeni door to Iran, says Michael Savage. by providing support, the Obama administration is empowering al Qaeda, which could do great harm to the United States. And that is a dangerous precedent. Savage: the Saudis are targeting an organization that is already receiving funding from Iran .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  supporting Saudi-led strikes on the Yemeni people is dangerous, because it can actually encourage it.. Supporting Saudi-led strikes on Yemen would not have the desired impact, according to Richard Goldman, who heads the Middle East Security Initiative. Rather, this would have the opposite effect. Goldman: Saudi intervention is simply part of the Saudi agenda, which is precisely the wrong one.

decoded_output_with_watermark:  's population is waning, and some experts say robots could replace workers. Another group willing to accept robots is Japan's seniors. A survey by Orix Living found more seniors would feel comfortable being cared for by a robot than foreign nurses.
decoded_output_with_watermark:  . Japanese think robots can provide much-needed assistance, but it would still be unacceptable to the elderly. In Japan, the elderly have the lowest acceptance rate of robots. And that is changing. One study estimated Japanese seniors would much rather have robots look after them than have one.
