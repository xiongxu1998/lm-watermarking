decoded_output_with_watermark:  not working and that U.S. leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region. Global. And. This is the problem. It is the reason why the region is not working. It is the reason why it is not working. And it is not working because the region is not working. The American public and politicians should be concerned.
decoded_output_with_watermark:  "the region is (not) working" and that misguided U.S. policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region. The "Obama doctrine" is significant because it clarifies the U.S. policy on the Middle East, which is clearly not working, writes Greg Daniels . The declaration, however, fails to recognize the fact that the region is not "living in peace," adding to the regional instability.

decoded_output_with_watermark:  when it comes to civil liability. All that said, there is a "gap" in the law on liability. Apparently, the unprovoked flight in the Baltimore case is significant in the legal debate over police use of force. s.e. cupp: the police narrative is key: the officer saw a knife, but he did not see the knife before stopping him. The police narrative is key: the stop was not unreasonable. The officers are not liable if the injury occurred after arrest.
decoded_output_with_watermark:  when it comes to civil liability. There is a major difference between the two. The police in Baltimore were stopped, captured the suspect, and arrested him. If that's true, the arrest is fair. If not, the officer is liable. If the officer is sued, it's not fair. If it is, it may not happen again. But it is important.
