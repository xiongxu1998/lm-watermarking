decoded_output_with_watermark:  when the twins were brought home. It was captured on the mom-and-pop station, which is now used worldwide. It was the second female quintuplet, but the mother kept the details on the floor. And now, it was official. There have now been three new female twins. And several new female twins. And now, the second is out.

decoded_output_with_watermark:  Stacey and Dannii Johnson are both battling brain tumours . in 2012, the family were told their tumours had grown . in 2014, they were then told their tumour had grown in size . new diagnosis shocked them as they feared they would have to treat both . sisters were born with neurofibromatosis, a condition that causes benign lumps and bumps, and are raising money to help cancer research .
decoded_output_with_watermark:  Stacey, now 22, from much hadham, was diagnosed with brain tumour 8 years ago . doctors discovered new growth last december, which was diagnosed last week . doctors now fear the brain tumour, which is Grade one, is malignant . Stacey, from much hadham, is now out of the office, but is helping out the charity "Kisses for kids," which gives days out when people have long-term illnesses. visit the website here. If you have brain tumour, visit the brain tumour charity.
